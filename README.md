## Overview

The Tamagotchi for LandTigerLPC1768 project is a bare-metal C and ARM assembly implementation of a Tamagotchi-like game for the LandTiger LPC1768 development board. The project includes libraries for frame-by-frame animation management, LCD controller interface enhancements, and sound management.

## Features

- **Frame-by-frame Animation Management**: Developed a library for efficient frame-by-frame animation using interrupts, optimizing performance.
- **Enhanced LCD Controller Interface**: Expanded the functionalities of the LCD controller interface, achieving a tenfold increase in refresh rate.
- **Sound Management Library**: Implemented a modular library for sound management, allowing playback of simple musical compositions through direct interaction with the embedded DAC within the speaker.
